# COMP-2040 Module 1 – Raw Data

This repository contains raw datasets for the COMP-2040 Module 1 exploratory data analysis (EDA) assignment. The files in this folder are unmodified source data and will be used for initial exploration and cleaning.

## Folder structure

- `raw-files/cover-crop-data/`  
  Raw CSV files related to cover crop experiments and agricultural measurements. These files may represent different sites, years, or experimental conditions.

- `raw-files/election-data/`  
  Raw CSV files related to election results and associated attributes. These may include different regions, time periods, or levels of aggregation.

- `raw-files/oilfieldaccidents.csv`  
  A single CSV containing records of oilfield accidents. Each row likely represents one incident with associated details (date, location, type of accident, etc.).

## Usage

For this assignment, each dataset will be explored in its own Jupyter notebook. The raw files will be loaded directly from GitHub using their raw URLs and then documented, profiled, and prepared for analysis in later modules.
