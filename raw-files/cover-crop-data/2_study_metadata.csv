7,3,Kelly Experimental Farm,2015-2016,Iowa,42.05,-93.71,FALSE,Randomized complete block design,4,Plot level,NA,Cover crop shoot dry matter samples were collected within 3 d of final chemical termination in spring. Dry matter sampling consisted of clipping all cover crops at the soil surface within a 0.76 m by 0.50 m frame placed at three random locations within each plot. The frame was centered on the row of the previous crop with the long side perpendicular to the row direction. Samples were dried at 60 degrees C and weighed; cover crop shoot biomass dry weights were then scaled up to per-plot value using the size of the sampling frames.
